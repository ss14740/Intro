For my final project, I have an idea to create a musical instrument that paints a painting on the screen. The instrument will be able to play various notes and be controlled by a sensor and a potentiometer. I will also include a switch to turn on the instrument, and a button that changes the tune of the instrument, which will change the colour/thickness of the strokes on the painting. I am still brainstorming the link between p5 and arduino and how the instrument interacts with the painting.
