For this week's assignment, Bato and I made a circuit that a digital sensor (a switch) and an analog sensor (a potentiometer). We first tried using a distance measuring sensor, but then found it easier to be creative with the potentiometer. We added a new file on arduino for the pitches, and selected seven notes from the pitches to include in our code. Then, we used if and else if statements to assign each note to a position on the dial of the potentiometer, so the notes play consecutively as the dial is turned. We then included the switch as another input of the speaker, and had the speaker play the notes if the switch (buttonValue) was switched on. We struggled with adding the switch, and so to trouble shoot, we used Serial.print and tested each aspect of our circuit to make sure everything worked on its own. Once we had everything running, we found that the notes sounded very garbled. We fixed this by changing the frequency of each note from 8 to 1000, which made the notes sound very clear.
