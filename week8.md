For this weeks assignment I created a electric circuit with my Arduino kit and with the power source of a computer. I used a similar wire formation to the one we learned in class with the red wires for the positive and the black wires for the negative charge. I then created a switch for the LED lights to turn on. I used my metal earrings as the conductor. I wanted to create a creative switch so I had the earrings connected but not touching. To turn on the switch, the earrings must touch. I found it difficult as first to think of a conductor, and one thing I could improve on is making sure I use the correct color wire, as I believe one of the wires connected to an earring should have been black.
