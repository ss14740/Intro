For week 9's assignment I attempted to use digitalRead, digitalWrite, analogRead, analogWrite in my arduino board. I figured out the analog, but struggled with the digital as I tried to build on top of the exisiting circuit and it was hard to know the right placement for the wires and other elements. My LED for the analog code worked and I used a potentiometer and turned the dial which made the LED glow bright and dim. My intention with the digital code was for the button to be pressed and for the red LED to light up, but was unsuccessful as seen in the video. I believe this has to do with the green wire which I had connected to ~5, which I matched with my code as what buttonPin is equal to. I'm unsure how to fix this issue. I struggle with this assignment and I intend on rewatching the recorded lectures to fill in my knowledge gaps.
