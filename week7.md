For my midterm, I coded a fashion themed video game where the player must dress up a woman in a fashionable outfit. I was inspired by video games I would play from childhood into my teenage years, and I overall really enjoy games that involve dragging objects together to create something aesthetically pleasing. For my code, I referenced a lot of previous assignments to get started. I started the code with a basic design of the room. I wanted something simple and calming to the eye. For the floorboards, I used the code from a previous assignment where we worked with variables i and j to loop shapes and elements. The floorboards were the background for the game, and next, I added a closet and a wall. Then, I added a window where I created an animation of a bird flying, using the tools learned from a previous assignment where we inputted an image and used arrays and frameCount. I had to use a lot of images for my code, which made me realize how much effort it took to find the right image in a png file. All my images are in a folder called assets to keep my sketch organized. The other images I uploaded were of a woman and several articles of clothing. I reviewed a lot about x and y coordinates in placing the images in the right spot, which reaffirmed my knowledge in the basics of code. The most difficult part of this assignment was using the mouseDragged function and making all the clothing items move seamlessly across the game. I had a lot of issues and glitches at first, but I was eventually able to figure out that I had to find the exact coordinates of the length and width of each object. Before I added “else if” to my function, the objects would group together as soon as they overlapped. I fixed this issue by adding boundaries for x and y, as well as moving the woman so that her upper body is level with the tops in the closet, and her lower body is level with the bottoms. A glitch still occurs when a top is dragged too far down, or a bottom is dragged too far up. Lastly, I added the win condition and loss condition for my game. The win condition is achieving the right combination of top and bottom for the outfit, and any wrong combination is met with a loss. I made sure that in coding for the win and loss conditions, I gave some room for slight misplacement of the top or bottom on the woman. I struggled with coding the loss condition at first, but I figured out eventually that it was due to the brackets being in the wrong place and that I wasn’t closing each chunk of code properly. 
Overall, I gained greatly from completing this midterm as most of the code I wrote was new and original. I had to figure out a lot of code on my own, which strengthened my ability to code and decipher code. I have a firmer grasp on loading images, using mouseDragged, and x and y coordinates. I am still learning more about arrays and frameCount, as I struggled with slowing the speed of the bird in the game. The project was very fun to complete and I enjoyed making something aesthetic and creative. The game I made is the kind of game I enjoy playing.
